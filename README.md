I followed the getting started tutorial of Angular 2 with TypeScript
	Lessons:
		How to setup the project with systemjs.config.js
		How to implement routing
		How is routing component different from other components
		How inMemory data service is implemented and used
		How $http service is used in association with inMemory web api service
I learnt about Angular Material 2 for Angular 2 projects
	Lessons:
		I learnt how Angular Material design works
		I followed Angular Material 2 official github repository and understood that the development is in Alpha stage
		Angular Material 2 official github page didn't help in getting started, One of the stackOverflow answers did help though
			I followed: npm install --save @angular2-material/{core,button,card}
			Later, to install @angular2-material/icon
				I got this link for future projects:
					https://www.npmjs.com/~angular2-material
					Installed icon: npm install --save @angular2-material/icon
